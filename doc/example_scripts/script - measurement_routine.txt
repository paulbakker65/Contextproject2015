# To view original records, run this script and visualize the number of measurements per phase
# per week by creating a frequency chart with chunk depth 2 and column "Measurement".
# Now deviations can be seen by comparing the count to the expected count, which is for each phase:
# -	phase 1: 7x / week
# -	phase 2: 3-4x / week
# -	phase 3: 2x / week
# -	phase 4: 1x / week
#
CONSTRAINT [Website].[Login] == "admire13"
CONSTRAINT [Website].[Measurement] == "Kreatinine (stat)"
# Chunk on each phase of the schedule.
CHUNK [Website].[Date] USING PHASE 1
# For every phase, chunk on a week, so all measurements can be seen.
FOR EACH CHUNK [Website] 1 CHUNK [Website].[Date] USING DAY 7
