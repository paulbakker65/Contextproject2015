## User Stories

### Story 1

It should be clear which features our product must have / could have. 

### Story 2

A user should be able to give the files which should be saved so we can perform operations on the data. 

## Problems

We had the wrog deadline of the Emergent Architecture Design in our agenda, so we had to plan some extra time to make this. It was finished on time.
