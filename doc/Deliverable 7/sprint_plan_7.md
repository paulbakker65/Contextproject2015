## User Stories

### Story 7

As a researcher I want to provide a custom analysis on my input so that I can filter the study data the way I need.

### Story 8

As a researcher I want to chain different analyses together so that a sequential analysis can be performed.

### Story 12

As a researcher I want to chunk the data so that I obtain a data structure more logical to my next analysis.

### Story 20
As a researcher I want visualize the new data so that I can determine what to analyse next.

### Story 21
As a researcher I want to create a XML file for the input file so that I can import this file into the program

### Story 22
As a researcher I want to have a manual of the program so that I can determine what the program can do.

##Reasons behind priority
The high priority task of the user stories are all part of must haves given by the customer. So we must implement those to make our product satisfactory for our customer. The medium tasks are should haves, tasks part of requirements we really want to implement to make our product stand out. There is only one low priority task this week and that is updating the emergent architecture design. We don’t think we are going to change the architecture this sprint so it hasn’t a high priority.In the organization we also have the task of removing duplicate code, this has a high priority as we want to make our code as efficient as possible.
