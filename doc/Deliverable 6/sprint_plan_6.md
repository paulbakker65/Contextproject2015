## User Stories

### Story 7

As a researcher I want to provide a custom analysis on my input so that I can filter the study data the way I need.

### Story 8

As a researcher I want to chain different analyses together so that a sequential analysis can be performed.

### Story 13

As a researcher I want to convert the data so that I obtain a data structure more logical to my next analysis.

### Story 17
As a researcher I want to put codes on the data so that I can detect behaviour patterns.

### Story 20
As a researcher I want visualize the new data so that I can determine what to analyse next.

##Reasons behind priority
For this sprint we have given the coupling of the script with the operations, the making of patterns and visualizing our data in two ways our highest priority. Coupling of the script for the data is an essential function of our program and we have started the coupling and hope to finish the other operations this week. For coding and conversion we want to give the user the ability to create codes on behaviour. By making it possible to create whatever pattern in our Pattern factory we will make this possible. Both of these operations are must haves. Furthermore we gave visualization this sprint a high priority given the feedback we got this Friday on what to focus on next. Therefore we need to make a new GUI to make it possible for the user to select the data he wants to visualize. The medium tasks are not necessary for the demo next Friday. Updating the Emergent Architecture Design has a low priority as we will most likely not change much in our core program so there is no big update needed.
