## User Stories

### Story 7

As a researcher I want to provide a custom analysis on my input so that filter the study data the way I need.

### Story 8

As a researcher I want to chain different analyses together so that a sequential analysis can be performed.
### Story 12

A a researcher I want to compare different bits of data so that the differences in the data can be analyzed.

### Story 13

As a researcher I want to convert the data so that to obtain a data structure more logical to my next analysis.

### Story 17
As a researcher I want to put codes on the data so that I can detect behaviour patterns.

### Story 18
As a researcher I want to call the program for the command line so that I can perform multiple analysis in rapid succession.

### Story 19
As a researcher I want to see the table I want to output so that I can see if every transformation worked.

##Brief reflection
This sprint was a very important one, as we wanted to couple our script to our operation for our demo this Friday. We did get most of our task done this week, but some features have only their basic functionality. That is what we want to focus on for the next sprint. We want to make the features works for the more difficult cases and extend their functionality. The script now works and makes the correct command, but we didnâ€™t have time to couple more operations together. For conversion we detect more complex patterns in the data but we do not yet merge the records into one or look for codes. These functions will be in the next sprint plan. We are happy that we did finish all the must have operations this sprint, that we got the basic script working, that we can import xlsx files and that we can call the GUI from the command line for fast adding of files. We did finish them all in the estimated effort and had a demo for the Friday meeting. Next sprint will be more polishing tasks and we will try to make the tasks smaller, as we did not finish all of them completely but only the basic functionality of the feature. So we will not make the task only containing a feature, but only as small portion of the feature so can check more easily if the task is still feasible.
