| User Story | Task 			       | Assigned to | Estimated Effort             | Priority |
|:----------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|:----------------------------:|
| Story 7/8  | The script must be parsed to a scripting engine | Matthijs    | 10 hours | High                      |
|			 | The scripting engine must convert the script into the correct transformations| Matthijs | 12 hours | High |
| Story 12	 |	The compare transformation should respresent the requirement of the user more closely | Jan | 5 hours | High |
|		|	The time must be parsed from the website data, possible needing to create a XLS-reader | Jan | 10 hours | Low |
| Story 13   | There must be converting possible in the current data format |Paul | 15 hours | High |
|			|	Converting must look at the codes | Paul | 3 hours | Low
| Story 17  | Multiple patterns must be made to look for different behaviour patterns. | Robin | 7 hours | High |
| 		 |	Create patterns for low frequency events | Robin | 8 hours |  Low |
| Story 18 | The program should be called by the command line | Julian | 10 hours | High |
|		Story 19	| The GUI should show the table after the transformations | Julian | 5 hours | Normal |
| Organisation		|	Additional test should be made for some data classes | Robin | 5 hours | Normal |
| 	 | Update emerging architecture | Jan | 2 hours | Normal |
|  | Make prototype for friday| Jan & Julian | 5 hours each | High |
|	| Packages should be reorganized | Julian | 2 hours | High |
|  | Sprint plan and reflection| Paul (scrum master) | 2 hours | Normal

## User Stories

### Story 7

As a researcher I want to provide a custom analysis on my input so that filter the study data the way I need.

### Story 8

As a researcher I want to chain different analyses together so that a sequential analysis can be performed.
### Story 12

A a researcher I want to compare different bits of data so that the differences in the data can be analyzed.

### Story 13

As a researcher I want to convert the data so that to obtain a data structure more logical to my next analysis.

### Story 17
As a researcher I want to put codes on the data so that I can detect behaviour patterns.

### Story 18
As a researcher I want to call the program for the command line so that I can perform multiple analysis in rapid succession.

### Story 19
As a researcher I want to see the table I want to output so that I can see if every transformation worked.
