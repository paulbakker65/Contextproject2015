## User Stories

### Story 1

As a researcher I want to input study data into the program so that I can analyze it.

### Story 2

As a researcher I want to specify the input format so that multiple study data sets can be read. 

### Story 9

A a researcher I want to place constraints on the data so that to discard data not relevant to this analysis.

### Story 10

As a researcher I want to obtain chunks of the data so that I can analyze chunks of data individually.

##Brief reflection

Even though this week we only had three work day we did finish everything we wanted to make. Robin implemented the parser and made numerous fixes so we could start implementing transformation operations on the data. Matthijs implemented the constraint operation and had even some time left to start working on our scripting language. Julian made the GUI for selecting all the files on which we want to perform data transformations and the corresponding XML settings files. The GUI can also select the script file and creates all the corresponding data-structures needed to start the analysis. Paul & Jan have implemented the chunking operations. Because there were two ideas on how to implement this, we made both to see which would work better. We think that because of this we have taken the best solution. But it took a lot of time to implement this operation. So for the next sprint we plan on dividing the tasks even more so only one person has a specify task, so we donâ€™t have duplicate functionality. The timetable we set this week was feasible and we finished everything on time.
