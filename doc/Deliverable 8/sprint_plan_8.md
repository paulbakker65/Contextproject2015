##Reasons behind priority
The high priority tasks of the user stories are all part of must haves given by the customer. So we must implement those to make our product satisfactory for our customer. The medium tasks are should haves, tasks part of requirements we really want to implement to make our product stand out. There are no low priority tasks this week as this is the final sprint for the code base so we want all these tasked finished.
